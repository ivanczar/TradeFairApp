# Trade Fair App
The Trade Fair App aims to provide users with all the relevant information they need to make the most of their time at fairs. Once logged in, users can add fairs they will be attending and view them all in one place. Users of this app can then access these fairs to view its attendees, timetable, and chat with other eventgoers. Finally, the user has the ability to view and edit their profile information and collect business cards to later view them in a cardholder.
This application was built with React Native and Javascript as this allows for a cross-platform app to be written in a single codebase within the time constraints of this project. 

## How to build the project:

- Download the "Expo Go" app from the app store, available both on Android Google Play Store and the IOS App store.
- Type ```expo start``` into the terminal to build the project. This will open metro bundler and will provide a QR code to scan using either the camera app (IOS) or the Expo Go app (Android).
- You may also use any device emulator of your choice (such as those available through Android Studio or Xcode) if you do not wish to download the Expo Go app.
- (In the case that dependencies are missing from the project upon build, type ```npm ci``` to perform a clean installation of dependencies).
